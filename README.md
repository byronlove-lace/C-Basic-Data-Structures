This repo includes projects I worked on to learn basic data structures like Linked Lists. 
I also used these programs to learn the basics of dynamic memory allocation and some simple sorting algorithms like BubbleSort and InsertSort.
The Timestamp_Project puts many of these skills to use in one project.
