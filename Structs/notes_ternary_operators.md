In the code snippet you provided, the question mark (`?`) is being used as part of the ternary conditional operator, also known as the ternary operator.

The ternary operator is a concise way to write conditional expressions and has the following syntax:

```c
condition ? expression1 : expression2
```

Here's what it does in your code:

```c
(i + 1) % 4 ? " " : "\n"
```

In this expression, `(i + 1) % 4` is the condition. If the condition evaluates to true (non-zero), the expression `" "` is returned. Otherwise, if the condition evaluates to false (zero), the expression `"\n"` is returned.

The purpose of this conditional expression is to determine whether to print a space or a newline character at the end of the `printf` format string. If `(i + 1) % 4` is non-zero, meaning the current iteration is not a multiple of 4, a space is printed. Otherwise, if `(i + 1) % 4` is zero, indicating the current iteration is a multiple of 4, a newline character is printed.

This helps format the output of the `printf` statement by controlling the spacing and line breaks between the printed values based on the value of `(i + 1) % 4`.
